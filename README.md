Very alpha build of a survival simulator that I'm working on...
It uses the Godot engine with Godot's custom scripting (very similar to Python). I have added a day/night cycle, initial crafting system, hunger/health meters, character customization, save/load system, and a context menu when the player interacts with items/people.
There is also an intro scene I am working on.

Need to add:
- Inventory
- Weather system
- NPC management
- Flesh out the crafting
- Fix any bugs
